# StrictDuck
A set of tools for building "intelligent" javascript code bases. The tools consist of:
`StrictDuck`: a retroactive classification / casting class (the default export)
`{ depends, provides, Composit }`: strictducks for creating "self aware, composable components" leveraging [bottle](https://github.com/young-steveo/bottlejs/tree/master/src/Bottle).

This is the cornerstone of [bufflehead](https://github.com/strictduck/bufflehead), and definitely needs to be cleaned up / broken down.
